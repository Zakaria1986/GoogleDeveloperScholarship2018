     <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
     <span>This is a span.</span>
   </body>
 </html>  
 ```
 
 Each <></> is an HTML element. Most elements have both an opening tag, <>, and a 
 closing tag, </>.  Some don't. 
 
 The stuff between an opening and closing tag is that element's content.  If devising a graph,
 we can think of an element's content as a child node of the element node...
 
 ## Paragraph vs Span
 A paragraph, <p></p>, is a block of text separate from other chunks of text. A span, <span></span>, is like
 a line of text; it really isn't separate from other pieces of text.

 ## (Strong & Em) vs (Bold & Italics)
 I always use <b> and <i>, but apparently the preferred elements are <strong> and <em>.
 
 You can learn about why on the [HTML Elements Refernce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
 available from the Mozilla Developer Network.
