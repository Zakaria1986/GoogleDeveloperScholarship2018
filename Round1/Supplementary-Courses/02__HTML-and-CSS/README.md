Similar to JavaScript, I've hacked through CSS quite a bit over the years... Yet when asked questions about it in
the "JavaScript and the DOM" course, I could not really answer.  Well, like they say: Before you can walk, you've gotta crawl.
Walk hard enough, and that might turn into a slow jog.  From there? The moon!

Anyway, time to go back to the basics!
