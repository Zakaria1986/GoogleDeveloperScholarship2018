Implementing a desire involves actions and decisions, which can represented as
a flow chart.  Flow charts can be converted into code.

```js
// Desire: want hammer ($15)
// In Pocket: $20
var hammer = 15
var inPocket = 20

// Do I have enough money?
if (inPocket >= hammer) {
  console.log("Buy the hammer!");
} else {
  console.log("Insufficient funds :-(");
}
```

Looks like JS if/else is like R's if/else.
