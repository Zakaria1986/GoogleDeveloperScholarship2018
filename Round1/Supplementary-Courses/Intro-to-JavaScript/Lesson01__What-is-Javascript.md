Not sure there will too many notes here...

JavaScript was originall called LiveScript, but was changed to JavaScript as
a marketing decision (to piggyback off Java's popularity at the time).  As time went on,
the language evolved in multiple directions, with no one true JavaScript.  This is
when ECMA stepped in and standardized releases of JavaScript.  This standardized version
of JavaScript is technically called ECMAScript, but is still referred to as JavaScript. The
ECMA prefix, however, is still retained in JavaScript version numbers.  For example,
ES5 is the version that has been in use for a while now, though some people are starting
to employ ES6.  To promote a more consistent release cycle, the nomenclature has moved
in the direction of ES2016, ES2017, etc. Point is, the naming scheme of JavaScript
can get confusing!

## JavaScript Console in Chrome Developer Tools
To get to the JavaScript Console in Chrome on a MacBook Pro, you can 2-finger click 
a webpage,  click on "Inspect", then click on"Console" tab in the window that opens up. Or,
you can just do cmd+alt+j.

```js
"Hello, World.";
alert("Hello Pop Up!");
```
```javascript
"Hello, World.";
alert("Hello Pop Up!");
```
