Program managers:
* Chaitra Ramanathan
* Nick Blumenthal

Receivd more than 100k applications.  Narrowed down selection to passionate, motivated,
resilient scholars.

Round 1: 
* 3 months to complete web development project
* engage on forums and private Slack channel
* if you're awesome, you will move on to round 2, a 6-month continuation
* first and foremost, learn and perform! 
* secondly, help others to do so as well

Why the challenge:
> "So, why do we have a challenge course? Well, we know that following an online course is hard. While the Phase 1 
> of the scholarship is relatively “light” in terms of content, the second part really requires a lot more work 
> (definitely 10–15 hours a week) . So, we want to make sure that the people who get selected will actually finish 
> their Nanodegree program; that they will put in the time, that they will persevere when they face an obstacle, 
> that they won’t abandon ship when things get harder. In an ideal world, we would like every single student who gets 
> awarded the full Nanodegree scholarship to go through with it. So this challenge course is designed to help us figure out 
> who has the right mindset for this, who really wants to learn and can show us that they deserve this. This is not a competition 
> against others, this is a competition against yourself, to prove to yourself that you can do this long term."

Some advice from a previous Google Scholar]()
* Complete your course material to 100%
* Use the forum: Read, ask questions, answer questions, post your work, start useful threads/topics, and you’ll be good.
* Participate in Slack: Udacity monitor all channels. Try to spend at least 10 minutes each day to see what’s going on.
