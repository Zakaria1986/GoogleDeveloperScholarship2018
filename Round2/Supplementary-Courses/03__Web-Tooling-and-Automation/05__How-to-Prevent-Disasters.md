## Linting
Linting is a way to automatically check your JS code for
errors, which can be done during various stages during development:
* in your editor (live linting)
* during your build process
* via a pre-commit hook in version control


Note that there are two breeds of linting: style linting and 
syntax linting.  Syntax linting is for the machines: this is the one
you need to make sure your code will run.  Style linting is for
other humans, maybe even yourself: it tries to get you to commit to
agreed upon best practices (e.g., so many characters per line, 
proper camel casing of var names, etc).

Popular JS Linters ([more info](https://www.sitepoint.com/comparison-javascript-linting-tools/)):
* JSHint
* JSCS
* ESLint

Both the course instructors and the author of the above article
recommend [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)... So that's what I'll use!

They use Sublime a lot in this course, but I use Vim for mostly everything,
so I need a way to map some of what they do to Vim.

Emmet seems cool:

I might also need some JS plugins:

I should find some YouTube videos of people who use Vim for web
development and go from there...  This page is probably helpful:
